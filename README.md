Maze 3d game.

I learned how to connect large js programs with css and html, and I finished understanding some concepts that had not been very clear. 
I realized that I have to review some of the local storage because I think it is not very well done.
I also did a validation of the form before starting the game.
I think that the representation of my game (the board) is not the best of all, I plan to change it later.

Notes

My DFS algorithm does not work all the time, the bigger the maze dimensions are the less it works, I checked the adapter and it works correctly, I checked all the algorithms and I can't find the fault, I spent a lot of time trying to fix it and I couldn't find the error.
The BFS works correctly
I think the code could be a little more organized.
